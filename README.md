FluidSim
Welcome to FluidSim, a Python-based fluid simulation tool that brings fluid dynamics to your fingertips. This project offers an intuitive and powerful way to simulate and visualize fluid behavior, making it an excellent resource for students, researchers, and anyone interested in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Features
2D Fluid Simulation: Simulate realistic fluid movement in two dimensions using Navier-Stokes equations.
Interactive Visualization: Observe fluid dynamics in real-time with adjustable parameters.
Customizable Settings: Modify grid size, time step, and other parameters to fine-tune your simulation.
Python-based: Built entirely with Python, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of use.
Lightweight and Fast: Efficient algorithms ensure the simulation runs smoothly even on modest hardware.
Installation
To get started with FluidSim, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ValiVKhan/FluidSim.git
cd FluidSim
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once installed, you can start the simulation by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python fluidsim.py
Adjusting Parameters
You can modify various simulation parameters directly in the fluidsim.py file. Key parameters include:

Grid Size: Adjust the resolution of the simulation grid.
Time Step: Control the speed and accuracy of the simulation.
Viscosity: Change the fluid's viscosity to simulate different types of liquids.
Visualization
FluidSim includes real-time visualization to help you observe and understand fluid behavior. The visualization window will pop up automatically when you run the simulation, allowing you to:

Pause/Resume the simulation.
Reset the fluid to its initial state.
Modify parameters on the fly.
